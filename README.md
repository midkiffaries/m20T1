# m20T1 - WordPress Theme
Version 1.0 BETA (In-Development)

This is simply a WordPress theme that I created from scratch, that I use on my own website
The intention is for this theme no be minimally reliant on plugins, and to rely on automation and the user to make any desired modifications to the style and code.

## Features
- Compatible with WordPress 5.8+
- Built in dark mode switch
- Sidebar support, including in the footer
- Featured image support
- Basic SEO support
- Breadcrumbs

## Disclaimer
This WordPress theme is just a pet project of mine, and I am happy to share the code, but there really is no support other than the issues that I come across.
