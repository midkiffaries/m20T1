This is simply a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> theme that I created from scratch, that I use on my own website.
The intention is for this theme is to be minimally reliant on 3rd party plugins while providing the same features that most popular plugins would provide. It does this by relying on the built in WordPress automation and features. This theme is built to be easy to work with from a coding standpoint.

## Features

## Disclaimer
This WordPress theme is just a pet project of mine, and I am happy to share the code, but there really is no support other than any issues that I come across.
