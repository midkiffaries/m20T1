This is simply a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> theme that I created from scratch, that I use on my own website.
The intention is for this theme is to be minimally reliant on 3rd party plugins while providing the same features that most popular plugins would provide. It does this by relying on the built in WordPress automation and features. This theme is built to be easy to work with from a coding standpoint.

## How to use this theme
This theme is not available on the official WordPress theme library. In order to use it on your own WordPress site, you first need to upload/FTP the folder <code>/m20T1-1.x.x-Live/</code> into <code>/wp-content/themes/</code>. From there the <b>m20T1</b> should automatically appear under "Appearance -> Themes" in your WordPress admin section.

FYI, this theme is configured for my personal website. I did however keep the personalized features and styles limited to the <code>functions.php</code>, <code>editor-style.css</code>, <code>theme.json</code> and the <code>style.css</code> files. You will need to go into those files to make necessary adjustments to the visuals other configuration changes.

## Custom CSS for use in the Editor
These CSS classes are usable in the Guetenburg editor and will render accordingly.
<ul>
  <li><code>.page-subtitle / .subtitle</code> - Used to make the subtitle text in a handwritten style font</li>
  <li><code>.alignjustify</code> - Justifies the text block</li>
  <li><code>.has-alpha</code> - Removes borders and background from an image element</li>
  <li><code>.fancy-border</code> - Adds a fancy border around an image element</li>
  <li><code>.add-drop-shadow</code> - Adds a drop shadow to an image element</li>
</ul>

## Disclaimer
This WordPress theme is just a personal pet project of mine, and I am happy to share the code, however there really is no support for it other than any issues that I come across while working on it for my personal website.
