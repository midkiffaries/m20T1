# m20T1 - WordPress Theme
Version 1.0 BETA (In-Development)

This is simply a WordPress theme that I created from scratch, that I use on my own website
The intention is for this theme no be minimally reliant on plugins, and to rely on automation and the user to make any modifications.

## Features
- Built in dark mode switch. 
- Sidebar support, including in the footer.
- Featured image support.
- Basic SEO support.
- Breadcrumbs.
- Etc.
